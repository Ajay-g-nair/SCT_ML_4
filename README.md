✅ Task 04 – Hand Gesture Recognition Using CNN
 I developed a Hand Gesture Recognition Model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

The objective of this project was to train a deep learning model capable of classifying images of various hand gestures, including a fist, palm, thumbs up, and more. This task allowed me to deepen my understanding of image classification and practical CNN implementation, while working with real-world data.

🔍 Project Overview:

📁 Dataset:

LeapGestRecog dataset from Kaggle, consisting of grayscale images of hand gestures captured in varying conditions and positions.

🛠 Tools & Technologies Used:

Python (Google Colab)

OpenCV – for image preprocessing

TensorFlow & Keras – for building and training the CNN

Matplotlib & Seaborn – for visualizing training performance

📌 Key Highlights:

Built and trained a CNN model from scratch for multi-class hand gesture classification.

Preprocessed image data using OpenCV to improve model performance.

Visualized training and validation accuracy/loss over epochs to monitor and fine-tune the model.

Made real-time predictions on unseen test images and interpreted the results using confidence scores.

Gained hands-on experience in building, training, and evaluating deep learning models using Keras.
